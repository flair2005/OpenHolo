# OpenHolo
The purpose of this application is to mimic the "Holoportation" concept by Microsoft, presented earlier in 2016. http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/holoportation/

This is just a side project and is not done in any professional or industrial capacity.

A secondary goal of this project is to make it easy to use and widely available, as long as you have:
1) At least one Microsoft Kinect
2) A separate USB Control Bus for each Microsoft Kinect.
3) Google Cardboard and a compatible phone.

This project uses the Microsoft Kinect version 1, Kinect SDK for Windows v1.8, OpenTK, and  .NET4.5.
